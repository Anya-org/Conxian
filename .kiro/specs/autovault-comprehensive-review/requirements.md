# AutoVault System Upgrade Requirements

## Introduction

AutoVault is a comprehensive Bitcoin-native DeFi platform built on Stacks with 75+ production-ready contracts and 130/131 passing tests. While the system demonstrates strong foundational architecture and security features, analysis against leading DeFi protocols reveals critical gaps that must be addressed to achieve enterprise-grade competitive positioning. This requirements document outlines the necessary enhancements to transform AutoVault from a Tier 2 to Tier 1 DeFi protocol while maintaining backward compatibility and leveraging its unique Bitcoin-native advantages.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying asset prices THEN the system SHALL provide TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) calculations over configurable periods
2. WHEN detecting price manipulation attempts THEN the system SHALL automatically reject suspicious price updates
3. WHEN external oracles fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative price sources or safe modes
4. WHEN price deviations exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger circuit breakers and halt affected operations
5. WHEN integrating new price feeds THEN the system SHALL support multiple oracle providers with weighted aggregation

### Requirement 6: Fee Structure Enhancement

**User Story:** As a liquidity provider, I want multiple fee tiers (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%) so that I can choose the appropriate risk/reward profile for different asset pairs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating pools THEN the system SHALL support multiple fee tier options (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%)
2. WHEN providing liquidity THEN the system SHALL clearly display expected fee earnings for each tier
3. WHEN trading volume varies THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust fee distributions based on utilization
4. WHEN comparing fee tiers THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on historical performance and optimal tier selection
5. WHEN fee structures change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing positions

### Requirement 7: MEV Protection Implementation

**User Story:** As a trader, I want protection from MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) attacks so that I receive fair execution prices without front-running or sandwich attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting large trades THEN the system SHALL implement commit-reveal schemes to prevent front-running
2. WHEN detecting sandwich attacks THEN the system SHALL automatically reject or delay suspicious transactions
3. WHEN batch processing transactions THEN the system SHALL use fair ordering mechanisms to prevent MEV extraction
4. WHEN MEV protection is active THEN the system SHALL maintain transaction throughput within 90% of unprotected performance
5. WHEN users opt for MEV protection THEN the system SHALL provide clear cost/benefit analysis and user controls

### Requirement 8: Enterprise Integration Features
