# Standards and Interoperability Guide

This document codifies standards for Conxian's Stacks DeFi system
to ensure security, efficiency, and seamless interoperability with other systems.

## Token Standard: SIP-010 (Fungible Tokens)

- Token interactions MUST target a configurable token principal,
  not a hardcoded contract.
  - Vault stores token principal in `var token` and uses it for `transfer` and `transfer-from`.
  - Safety: Token changes are only allowed when the vault is paused and empty.

- Use `as-contract` when the vault triggers token transfers to ensure correct `tx-sender`.

- Ensure allowance flows for `deposit` use `transfer-from` and require user approvals.

- Post-conditions SHOULD be used by callers for critical transfers and state changes.

- Recommended minimal SIP-010 surface used:
  - `transfer(recipient, amount) -> (response bool uint)`
  - `transfer-from(sender, recipient, amount) -> (response bool uint)`
  - `get-balance-of(owner) -> (response uint uint)`

## Vault Interface Standard (ERCâ€‘4626 inspired)

Introduce a standard vault trait for cross-system composability.
This trait is defined at `stacks/contracts/traits/vault-trait.clar`.

```clarity
(define-trait vault-trait
  (
    (deposit (user principal) (amount uint) (response uint uint))
    (withdraw (user principal) (amount uint) (response uint uint))

    (get-balance (user principal) (response uint uint))
    (get-total-assets () (response uint uint))
    (preview-deposit (amount uint) (response uint uint))
    (preview-withdraw (amount uint) (response uint uint))

    (get-token () (response principal uint))
    (paused () (response bool uint))
  )
)
```

Notes:

- Current `vault.clar` retains the existing method signatures
  for backwards compatibility with tests and integrations.

- A migration path will be planned to either:
  - Add wrapper entrypoints that conform to `vault-trait`, or
  - Introduce `v2` vault that implements the trait directly.

## Strategy and Oracle Adapters

- Strategy trait SHOULD expose a minimal interface
  for deposit/withdraw of assets and reporting of realized PnL or asset growth.

- Oracle trait SHOULD expose a standardized price query
  with data source, freshness checks, and decimals.

- Registry SHOULD record vault-strategy relationships by trait reference,
  not by concrete contract, to allow hot-swaps via governance.

## Governance & Auth

- All admin-changing and parameter updates SHOULD be gated by a timelock
  (queue/execute) owned by a DAO or multi-sig per environment.

- Critical state transitions:
  - Pause before upgrades or token changes; require empty vault for token change.
  - Enforce caps, rate-limits, and fee bounds on user operations.

- Emit events for all admin and user actions to support indexers and off-chain monitoring.

## Security Controls

- Invariants:
  - `total-balance` equals sum of all user balances.
  - Reserves cannot underflow and cannot be withdrawn beyond their balances.
  - Caps and rate limits are always enforced when enabled.

- Parameter constraints:
  - Fees `<= 10000 bps`.
  - `min-withdraw-fee < max-withdraw-fee`.
  - `util-high > util-low`.

- Upgrades:
  - Prefer new deployments and registry/dispatcher patterns;
    avoid in-place mutation of logic.

## Interop Guidelines

- Avoid hardcoding contract principals;
  store references in data-vars and expose getters.

- Use traits for all cross-contract interactions.

- Provide `read-only` view functions for critical state to support off-chain clients.

- Emit structured `print` events for deposits, withdrawals, and governance changes.

## Nakamoto Compatibility & Backward Compatibility

### Core Principles
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All upgrades must maintain compatibility with existing systems during Nakamoto rollout
2. **Gradual Migration**: Provide migration paths for existing contracts
3. **Feature Flags**: Use conditional execution for new features
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement safety nets for failed operations

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use SDK 3.5.0's `contract-call?` for safe cross-contract interactions
- Implement versioned APIs with `define-public-v2` for new features
- Use feature detection patterns:
```clarity
(if (is-eq (contract-call? 'ST000000000000000000002AMW42H get-version) "nakamoto")
    (execute-nakamoto-feature)
    (legacy-behavior))
```
- Maintain separate entry points for Nakamoto-specific features

### Cross-chain Integration
- **Bridge Contracts**: Use SDK 3.5.0's new cryptographic primitives for secure cross-chain messaging
- **Wrapped Assets**: Implement wrapped tokens with backward-compatible interfaces
- **Liquidity Pools**: Create dedicated pools for cross-chain assets with enhanced slippage protection

## SDK 3.5.0 Security Features

### New Security Capabilities
1. **Enhanced Signatures**: Support for Schnorr signatures via `verify-schnorr-sig`
2. **Timelock Improvements**: More granular timelock controls with `set-timelock-duration`
3. **Oracle Safeguards**: Built-in price freshness checks with `oracle-freshness-threshold`
4. **Reentrancy Protection**: Automatic reentrancy guards on public functions

### Implementation Example
```clarity
(define-public (secure-transfer (amount uint))
  (begin
    ;; Use new SDK 3.5.0 reentrancy guard
    (asserts! (not (is-reentrant)) (err u1))
    
    ;; Use Schnorr signature verification
    (asserts! (verify-schnorr-sig msg-sender signature public-key) (err u2))
    
    (try! (transfer amount))
    (ok true)))
```

## Testing & Observability

- Unit tests SHOULD cover:
  - Deposit/withdraw happy paths and edge cases (caps, rate-limits, fees).
  - Timelock queue/execute for admin actions.
  - Reserve accounting and withdrawals.
  - Token change safeguards (paused + empty).

- Add preview functions to support client UX and testing of slippage/fees.

## Status

- Implemented: dynamic SIP-010 token usage in `vault.clar`.
- Added: `vault-trait.clar` (not yet implemented by the current vault for compatibility).
- Added: Nakamoto compatibility standards and SDK 3.5.0 security features
- Next: Implement wrapper contracts for Nakamoto features
