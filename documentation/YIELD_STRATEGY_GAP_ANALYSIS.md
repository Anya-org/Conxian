# Conxian Yield Strategy & Vault Architecture Gap Analysis

**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Focus**: Vault strategies, yield optimization, and automated yield farming compared to industry leaders

## Executive Summary

Analysis of Conxian's yield strategy architecture against 8 leading yield protocols reveals **significant opportunities** for yield optimization enhancements. Current vault implementation provides solid foundation but lacks advanced yield strategies, auto-compounding mechanisms, and multi-protocol integration that define industry leaders.

**Key Finding**: Conxian vault mechanism is **technically sound** but **strategically limited** compared to sophisticated yield optimization platforms.
