# Conxian Security Documentation

This document outlines Conxian's security architecture, implemented
protections, and audit readiness.

## Security Overview

Conxian implements enterprise-grade security with multiple layers of protection:

- 5 AIP Security Implementations active
- Multi-signature Treasury controls
- Emergency Pause mechanisms
- Rate Limiting protection
- Time-weighted Governance anti-manipulation

## Core Security Features

### 1. Emergency Pause System (AIP-1)

Status: ACTIVE

```clarity
Emergency Controls:
├── Vault Operations: Instant pause capability
├── Treasury Spending: Halt all disbursements  
├── DAO Governance: Pause proposal execution
├── Token Transfers: Emergency freeze functionality
└── Admin Override: Multi-sig emergency access
```

**Implementation**:

- All major functions include pause checks
- Emergency pause can be triggered by admin or DAO vote
- Granular control over individual system components
- Automatic resume after investigation period

### 2. Time-Weighted Voting (AIP-2)

Status: ACTIVE

```clarity
Vote Weight Calculation:
├── Base Weight: Token holdings at proposal creation
├── Time Factor: Bonus for holding duration (up to 25%)
├── Participation: Bonus for consistent voting (+10%)
├── Anti-Flash: Prevents last-minute whale attacks
└── Decay Function: Reduces power of dormant tokens
```

**Protection Against**:

- Flash loan governance attacks
- Last-minute whale manipulation
- Sybil voting schemes
- Vote buying attempts

### 3. Treasury Multi-Signature (AIP-3)

Status: ACTIVE

```clarity
Multi-Sig Requirements:
├── Spending Proposals: 2-of-3 signatures required
├── Parameter Changes: 3-of-5 signatures required
├── Emergency Actions: 1-of-3 signatures (with justification)
├── Key Rotation: 4-of-5 signatures required
└── Contract Upgrades: 5-of-5 signatures + DAO approval
```

**Key Management**:

- Hardware wallet integration for production keys
- Geotextic distribution of signers
- Regular key rotation procedures
- Emergency recovery mechanisms

### 4. Bounty Security Hardening (AIP-4)

Status: ACTIVE

```clarity
Bounty Protections:
├── Double-Spend Prevention: State tracking prevents duplication
├── Merit Verification: Work-proof required before payment
├── Rate Limiting: Maximum bounties per creator per epoch
├── Quality Assurance: Community review before approval
└── Treasury Integration: DAO approval for large bounties
```

**Anti-Abuse Measures**:

- Creator reputation tracking
- Work verification requirements
- Payment escrow system
- Community dispute resolution

### 5. Vault Precision (AIP-5)

Status: ACTIVE

```clarity
Precision Protections:
├── High-Precision Math: 18-decimal internal calculations
├── Rounding Protection: Consistent rounding to prevent manipulation
├── Overflow Guards: Safe arithmetic operations
├── Balance Verification: Continuous invariant checking
└── Share Price Stability: Protection against price manipulation
```

**Mathematical Security**:

- All calculations use safe arithmetic
- Precision loss mitigation strategies
- Share price manipulation protection
- Balance invariant preservation

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-1 hour)

1. **Trigger Emergency Pause**: Halt all operations
2. **Assess Threat**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Secure Assets**: Protect treasury and user funds
4. **Communication**: Alert users and stakeholders

### Investigation Phase (1-24 hours)

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify attack vector
2. **Impact Assessment**: Calculate potential losses
3. **Fix Development**: Prepare security patches
4. **Community Update**: Transparent communication

### Recovery Phase (24-72 hours)

1. **Deploy Fixes**: Implement security improvements
2. **System Testing**: Verify all functions work correctly
3. **Gradual Resume**: Phased restoration of services
4. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned

## 🔍 Audit Readiness

### Code Quality

- **30 Smart Contracts**: Core + monitoring + DEX groundwork compiling
- **65 Test Cases**: 100% passing including circuit-breaker & baseline DEX
- **Documentation**: Updated (Aug 17, 2025) aligning with implementation
- **Clean Code**: Legacy variants pruned; no unreferenced contracts

### Security Testing

```bash
# Comprehensive test suite
npm test
# Expected: 65/65 tests passing

# Security-specific tests
npm run test:security
# Expected: All security features validated

# Integration testing
npm run test:integration
# Expected: Cross-contract security verified
```
