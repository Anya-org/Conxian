# Restoration & Decommission Audit (Conxian)

Purpose: Inventory all archived, original, backup, and disabled contract variants to (a) ensure no critical differentiating functionality is lost prior to repository cleanup, (b) decide restore vs merge vs remove actions, (c) map each feature to PRD / AIP alignment, (d) surface gaps to re‑enable before mainnet.

Date: 2025-08-18  
Baseline Test State: 113/113 passing (simnet)  
Contracts Checked: 32 active (+ archived variants)  

## Legend

Action Codes: KEEP (retain as-is), MERGE (fold unique logic into active), RESTORE (reactivate variant), REMOVE (safe to delete after merge), DEFER (needs design/spec + tests first).  
Rationale Tags: SEC (security), PERF (performance/gas), SIZE (contract size), PRD (product requirement), AIP (Conxian Improvement Proposal), DX (developer clarity), AUDIT (3rd-party audit friendliness), LEG (legacy reference value).

## Variant Inventory Matrix

| Domain | Active Contract | Variant(s) | Unique Features Present ONLY in Variant | Status in Active | Risk if Dropped | Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| Vault Core | `vault.clar` | `vault-original.clar` | None (original lacks: performance fees, flash loans, liquidation, precision shares, revenue stats) | Superset implemented | Low (original simpler) | REMOVE (post-archive tag) | Active is strict superset; keep original commit hash in CHANGELOG for audit (DX, AUDIT). |
| Treasury | `treasury.clar` | `backup-20250816-090206/treasury.clar` | Simpler model without multisig & growth strategy scheduling nuance | Active adds multisig, growth, rebalance, compounding | Low | REMOVE (after confirm no regression tests rely on backup path) | Backup offers no extra logic; increases audit surface (SEC). |
| Governance | `dao-governance.clar` | `dao-governance-original.clar`, `enhanced-dao-governance.clar` | Original lacks test-mode / AIP-2 integration; enhanced-dao-governance duplicates time-weighted snapshot subset | Active integrates time-weighted voting + test-mode | None (duplication) | MERGE then REMOVE variants | Remove redundancy to reduce attack surface; ensure AIP-2 doc references single implementation (SEC, AUDIT). |
| Bounty System | `bounty-system.clar` | `bounty-system-original.clar` | Original lacks AIP-4 dispute + proof system (submission-proofs, disputes) | Active includes AIP-4 | None | REMOVE original | Active strictly superior; retain for diff until audit sign-off (AIP-4). |
| DEX Weighted Pool | `weighted-pool.clar` | `weighted-pool.clar.disabled` | Disabled version returned richer swap result `{ amount-out, fee }`; different remove-liquidity field names; legacy fee exposure | Fee transparency restored via `last-swap-fee` var + `get-last-swap-fee` read-only; swap event already emits fee | Low (addressed) | COMPLETED (Option B) | Non-breaking restoration preserving `pool-trait`; test `weighted_pool_fee_test.ts` added (PRD, DX, AUDIT). |
| DEX Stable Pool | `stable-pool.clar` | `stable-pool-clean.clar` (if exists beyond placeholder) | (Not yet diffed – pending) | - | Unknown | DEFER | Perform targeted diff if we keep both; currently only one active in Clarinet.toml (`stable-pool.clar`). |
| Circuit Breaker | `circuit-breaker.clar` | `circuit-breaker-simple.clar` | Simple version smaller; fewer guardrails; potential fallback minimal pause logic | Active adds richer triggers | None | KEEP both until gas benchmarking | Simple variant may serve as lightweight fallback; revisit after gas data (PERF). |
| Governance Automation | `dao-automation.clar` | (no variant) | - | - | - | KEEP | - |
| Oracle | `oracle-aggregator.clar` | (no variant) | - | - | - | KEEP | - |
| Timelock | `timelock.clar` | (no variant) | - | - | - | KEEP | - |

## Weighted Pool Restoration Detail

Diff Highlights (disabled vs active):

1. `swap-exact-in` response: disabled => `{ amount-out, fee }`; active => `{ amount-out }` (fee omitted).  
2. `remove-liquidity` response field names: disabled => `{ amount-a, amount-b }`; active => `{ dx, dy }` (trait alignment).  
3. `get-fee-info`: disabled returns map with keys `lp-fee-bps`, `protocol-fee-bps` (no tuple). Active returns tuple form `(lp-fee-bps, protocol-fee-bps)`.  
4. Active adds BETA warning header to dissuade prod reliance.  

Restoration Execution: Implemented Option B (non-breaking). Added `(define-data-var last-swap-fee uint u0)` and `(define-read-only (get-last-swap-fee) ...)`; fee stored during `swap-exact-in`. Trait return tuple remains `{ amount-out }`. Test `weighted_pool_fee_test.ts` validates zero-initialization, liquidity addition, swap fee capture (example observed fee `u27`).

## Removal Safety Checklist

Before deleting any variant file:  

1. Confirm no tests import or reference variant (grep + run full suite).  
2. Archive diff snippet into `documentation/ARCHIVE_DIFFS.md` (hash, lines changed).  
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under Unreleased: "Removed legacy variant `<file>` (superseded by `<active-file>`, no unique logic)".  
4. Re-run `npx clarinet check` + full tests (must remain green).  
5. Tag PR with `refactor:contract-cleanup` and note AIP impact (none or specify).  

## Planned Actions (Ordered)

1. (DONE) Reinstate fee visibility in weighted pool (read-only accessor, no trait change).
2. (DONE) Add integration test for weighted pool fee tracking.
3. Remove governance / bounty / vault original variants post-diff archival.
4. Evaluate necessity of keeping `circuit-breaker-simple.clar` (decide after gas benchmarking).  
5. Add automated script to assert no stray `*-original.clar` or `*.disabled` files pre-mainnet (CI gate).  
6. Un-comment or implement treasury spend execution path in `dao-governance.clar` once treasury integration test added (currently stubbed).  
7. Consolidate time-weighted voting logic (remove `enhanced-dao-governance.clar`).  

## Open Questions / Follow-ups

| Topic | Question | Proposed Resolution |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Pool Trait Return | Does `pool-trait` strictly constrain swap return tuple shape? | Inspect `pool-trait.clar`; if strict, add separate read-only for fee. |
| Stable Pool Clean Variant | Is `stable-pool-clean.clar` intended as refactor candidate? | Diff & document in follow-up audit. |
| Circuit Breaker Simple | Keep as fallback? | Decide after measuring gas & size trade-offs. |
| Governance Treasury Exec | When to re-enable execution function? | After adding test covering treasury spend & timelock path. |

## Decision Summary

Current unique, beneficial logic not present in active code: ONLY weighted pool richer swap return (fee). All other variants are supersets in active contracts; safe to remove after documentation.
