## **📊 ACTUAL SMART CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION**

### **CXVG Token (cxvg-token.clar)**

```clarity
Token: AutoVault Governance (CXVG)
Max Supply: 100,000,000 CXVG (100M for broader participation)
Decimals: 6 (micro-CXVG precision)

Migration Epochs (Extended 4-Year Schedule):
├── Epoch 1 (Blocks 1 – ~52,560): 1.0 CXVG per AVLP baseline
├── Epoch 2 (Blocks ~52,561 – ~105,120): Dynamic 1.1–1.3 CXVG per AVLP (incentive based on remaining AVLP)
├── Epoch 3 (Blocks ~105,121 – ~157,680): Dynamic 1.3–1.6 CXVG per AVLP (incentive based on remaining AVLP)
└── Epoch 4 (Blocks ~157,681 – ~210,240): Dynamic 1.6–2.0 CXVG per AVLP (final incentive band)

Revenue Distribution:
├── 80% to CXVG holders (REVENUE_SHARE_BPS: 8000)
└── 20% to protocol treasury (TREASURY_RESERVE_BPS: 2000)
```

### **AVLP Token (avlp-token.clar)**

```clarity
Token: AutoVault Liquidity Provider (AVLP)
Max Supply: 50,000,000 AVLP (50M for enhanced liquidity)
Decimals: 6 (micro-AVLP precision)
Purpose: Temporary token that migrates to CXVG

Liquidity Mining:
├── Base Rewards: Per-block emissions based on epoch
├── Loyalty Bonuses: 5-25% extra for long-term LPs
├── Progressive Migration: Increasing CXVG conversion rates
└── Emergency Migration: Auto-convert after Epoch 4
```

## **🚀 PRODUCTION TOKENOMICS FEATURES**

├── Snapshot: Per-epoch revenue calculation  
├── Distribution: 80% to CXVG holders proportionally
├── Claims: On-demand revenue claiming by holders
└── Reserve: 20% retained for protocol operations
```

## **📊 PRODUCTION ECONOMICS (100M Token Economy)**

### **Actual Implementation Economics**

```clarity
Revenue Distribution Model (implemented):
├── Monthly Protocol Revenue → Treasury Collection
├── Epoch Snapshots → Revenue per CXVG calculation  
├── Proportional Distribution → 80% to CXVG holders
├── On-Demand Claims → Users claim earned revenue
└── Treasury Reserve → 20–40% for protocol sustainability (governance adjustable target band)

Token Distribution (implemented in contracts):
CXVG Supply: 100,000,000 tokens
├── DAO Community: 30,000,000 (30%) - Broad participation
├── Team/Founders: 20,000,000 (20%) - Vested over time
├── Treasury Ops: 20,000,000 (20%) - Protocol operations  
├── Migration Pool: 20,000,000 (20%) - ACTR/AVLP conversion
└── Reserve Fund: 10,000,000 (10%) - Emergency expansion

AVLP Supply: 50,000,000 tokens (migrates to CXVG)
├── LP Rewards: 30,000,000 (60%) - Mining incentives
└── Migration Pool: 20,000,000 (40%) - Direct conversion
```

### Post-Vesting Ownership Transition & Bounty Alignment

After the initial **Team/Founders 20,000,000 CXVG** allocation vests (standard linear unlock with cliffs as defined in governance policy), any unutilized governance influence (unvoted, idle, or treasury-held remainder earmarked for team incentives) transitions under a structured bounty mandate to ensure long-term decentralization and continued innovation.

| Phase | Trigger Condition | Action | Target Outcome |
|-------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| P0 (Active) | Pre-vesting | Standard founder voting + vesting locks | Stable initial stewardship |
| P1 (Transition Start) | 50% of founder allocation vested | Begin metering idle (non-voted for N epochs) founder-controlled voting power into Bounty Allocation Queue (BAQ) at 2% per epoch | Reduce passive concentration |
| P2 (Acceleration) | 75% vested & <60% cxvg founder vote participation (rolling 90d) | Increase reallocation rate to 4% per epoch (capped) | Incentivize active governance or dilution |
| P3 (Completion) | 100% vested OR 48 months elapsed | Lock remaining unreleased founder incentive pool; mint equivalent bounty-backed escrow (BES) entries | Full decentralization of surplus |

Reallocated governance units are not dumped to market; they are streamed into the **Automated Bounty System** (see `automated-bounty-system.clar`) via:

1. Emission Registry Entry: `bounty-governance-stream` (epoch-indexed)
2. Rate Governor: Caps BAQ inflow to max 1% of circulating CXVG per 30-day window
3. Merit Filters: Bounty categories (security, core feature, protocol research) weighted by DAO-approved priority multipliers
4. Vest-on-Award: Granted CXVG to bounty winners vests over 3 months with 1-month cliff to mitigate instant sell pressure

### DAO & Metrics System Enhancements (Post-Ownership Transition)

| Enhancement | Description | Contract / Subsystem Impact | KPI Tracked |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Governance Participation Oracle | Tracks vote participation %, quorum efficiency, proposal latency | New analytics contract or extension | Participation %, quorum time |
| Dynamic Delegation Router | Auto-suggests delegate assignments for idle holders | DAO interface + off-chain agent | Delegated voting coverage |
| Bounty Performance Index | Measures ROI of bounty spend (reward / merged LOC quality score) | Add map + event in bounty system | Cost efficiency score |
| Contribution Reputation Layer | Non-transferable reputation for high-signal contributors affecting bounty weight | New `reputation-token` (soulbound) | Reputation distribution Gini |
| Emission Transparency Dashboard | Real-time stream of founder-to-bounty reallocations | Indexer + events (`founder-realloc`) | Reallocated CXVG %, epoch cadence |

#### Metrics Auto-Adjustment Logic

The governance automation can periodically (epoch advance hook):

```
If participation_90d < 55% and founder_realloc_progress < 60%:
 increase reallocation_rate by +0.5% (bounded)
If bounty_success_rate (merged / funded) < 65%:
 raise security & infrastructure bounty multiplier by +10%
If proposal_latency_median > target_latency:
 auto-schedule governance streamlining proposal
```

#### Security & Economic Safeguards

- Hard Cap: Total founder → bounty reallocation cannot exceed original 20,000,000 allocation.
- Circuit Breaker: DAO can pause reallocation (2/3 vote) for 14 days if exploit suspected.
- Transparency: All realloc events emit `{ event: "founder-realloc", epoch, amount }`.
- Non-Circular Incentives: Bounty payouts cannot fund proposals solely aimed at increasing bounty share.

#### Required Additions (Engineering Roadmap)

| Component | Change | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `cxvg-token.clar` | Add `founder-reallocation-enabled` flag + event | High |
| `dao-governance.clar` | Hook: check participation metric; compute realloc delta | High |
| `automated-bounty-system.clar` | Accept governance stream deposits | High |
| New `governance-metrics.clar` | Track participation, quorum, latency | Medium |
| New `reputation-token.clar` | Non-transferable contributor cred | Medium |
| Off-chain Indexer | Aggregate & expose dashboard metrics | Medium |

### **Economic Projections (Conservative Estimates)**

| Timeline | Monthly Revenue | CXVG Holder Share | Revenue per Token |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Month 1-3** | $50K-100K | $40K-80K | 1.3-2.7 cents |
| **Month 4-6** | $100K-250K | $80K-200K | 2.7-6.7 cents |
| **Month 7-12** | $250K-500K | $200K-400K | 6.7-13.3 cents |
| **Year 2** | $500K-1M | $400K-800K | 13.3-26.7 cents |
| **Mature State** | $1M+ | $800K+ | 26.7+ cents |

### **Broader Participation Benefits (100M vs 10M Supply)**

- **Lower Entry Barrier**: Greater nominal unit granularity for new entrants
- **Reduced Whale Risk**: Additional decimal & higher cap distribution lowers concentration
- **Better Liquidity**: Higher circulating supply deepens order books & governance reach
- **Scalable Growth**: Revenue per token remains attractive under expanded participation
