## Staking Guide

### CXD Staking (xCXD)

Staking CXD tokens creates xCXD positions that earn revenue from protocol fees.

#### How to Stake

1. **Initiate Staking:**
   ```
   Minimum: 1 CXD
   Maximum: 10,000,000 CXD per user
   Warmup Period: 2 weeks (mainnet) / 1 day (testnet)
   ```

2. **Warmup Period:**

   - Newly staked tokens enter a warmup period
   - No revenue earned during warmup
   - Prevents snapshot sniping attacks
   - Can withdraw during warmup without penalties

3. **Active Staking:**

   - Earn proportional share of protocol revenue
   - Revenue distributed weekly
   - Compounding available through restaking
   - Can add more CXD to existing position

4. **Unstaking Process:**

   ```text
   Cooldown Period: 4 weeks (mainnet) / 1 day (testnet)
   Immediate Exit: Available with penalty
   Scheduled Exit: Full amount after cooldown
   ```

#### Revenue Distribution

- **Sources:** Vault fees, DEX fees, migration fees, dimensional yield
- **Split:** 70% to stakers, 20% treasury, 10% reserves
- **Frequency:** Weekly distribution cycles
- **Claiming:** Manual claiming or auto-compound options

#### Staking Strategies

1. **Long-term Holders:**
   - Stake for consistent revenue stream
   - Benefit from compound growth
   - Participate in governance decisions

2. **Active Traders:**
   - Monitor revenue cycles for optimal entry/exit
   - Consider warmup/cooldown periods in timing
   - Use fee discounts for trading benefits

## Governance Participation

### CXVG Locking Mechanism

Lock CXVG tokens to participate in governance and earn utilities.

#### Locking Process

1. **Choose Lock Duration:**
   ```
   Minimum: 6 months (mainnet) / 1 week (testnet)
   Maximum: 2 years
   Longer locks = Higher voting power + Better fee discounts
   ```

2. **Lock Your CXVG:**
   - Select amount and duration
   - Confirm transaction
   - Tokens become locked and non-transferable
   - Begin earning voting power and fee discounts

#### Voting Power Calculation

```
Voting Power = Locked Amount × Time Multiplier
Time Multiplier = 1.0 + (Lock Duration / Max Duration)
```

#### Fee Discount Tiers

| Locked CXVG | Discount | Additional Benefits |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| 10K+        | 5%       | Basic governance access |
| 100K+       | 10%      | Priority proposal queue |
| 1M+         | 20%      | Enhanced voting weight |
| 5M+         | 30%      | Governance council eligibility |

### Creating Proposals

1. **Proposal Requirements:**
   - Bond 10,000 CXVG (refunded if successful)
   - Minimum 6-month lock period
   - Clear proposal specification
   - Community discussion period

2. **Proposal Process:**
   ```
   1. Bond CXVG tokens
   2. Submit proposal with rationale
   3. Community review (1 week)
   4. Voting period (1 week)
   5. Implementation (if passed)
   ```

3. **Proposal Types:**
   - Parameter changes (fees, limits, durations)
   - New feature additions
   - Integration partnerships
   - Treasury allocation decisions

### Voting Process

1. **Eligible Votes:** Lock CXVG for minimum duration
2. **Voting Period:** 1 week for most proposals
3. **Quorum:** Minimum 10% of locked CXVG must participate
4. **Threshold:** 60% approval required for passage

## Revenue Sharing

### Revenue Sources

The protocol generates revenue from multiple sources that are distributed to CXD stakers:

1. **Vault Management Fees (0.5%-1%):**
   - Charged on vault deposits/withdrawals
   - Performance fees on vault profits
   - Automated strategy execution fees

2. **DEX Trading Fees (0.3%):**
   - Swap fees from dimensional DEX
   - Liquidity provision rewards
   - Arbitrage and market making

3. **Migration Fees:**
   - CXLP to CXD conversion fees
   - Legacy system transition charges
   - Migration bonus adjustments

4. **Dimensional Yield:**
   - Dimensional staking rewards
   - Cross-dimensional arbitrage profits
   - Yield farming optimization returns

5. **Tokenized Bond Coupons:**
   - Bond interest payments
   - Bond maturation proceeds
   - Secondary market trading fees

### Distribution Mechanics

1. **Collection:** All fees flow to revenue distributor contract
2. **Accumulation:** Fees accumulate over weekly periods  
3. **Distribution:** Weekly distribution to active stakers
4. **Claiming:** Manual claim or automatic restaking options

### Revenue Calculation

```
Your Share = (Your Staked CXD / Total Staked CXD) × Weekly Revenue × 70%
```

### Maximizing Returns

1. **Stake Early:** Benefit from protocol growth
2. **Long-term Holding:** Avoid warmup/cooldown periods
3. **Compound Returns:** Restake earned revenue
4. **Fee Discounts:** Lock CXVG to reduce protocol fees

## Migration Guide

### CXLP to CXD Migration

Existing liquidity providers can migrate CXLP tokens to CXD with time-based bonuses.

#### Migration Mechanics

1. **Time Bands:**
   - Band 1 (Months 1-6): 110% conversion rate
   - Band 2 (Months 7-12): 108% conversion rate
   - Band 3 (Months 13-24): 105% conversion rate
   - Band 4 (Months 25+): 100% conversion rate

2. **Migration Limits:**
   ```
   Epoch Cap: 1M CXD per week
   User Base: 10K CXD per user per epoch
   User Max: 500K CXD per user total
   ```

3. **Migration Process:**
   ```
   1. Check current migration band
   2. Calculate expected CXD output
   3. Submit migration transaction
   4. Receive CXD tokens (can immediately stake)
   ```

#### Migration Strategy

1. **Early Migration Benefits:**
   - Higher conversion rates
   - Priority in epoch caps
   - Immediate staking eligibility

2. **Timing Considerations:**
   - Monitor epoch usage to avoid caps
   - Consider gas costs vs. bonus amounts
   - Plan for immediate CXD staking
