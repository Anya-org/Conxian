A production-ready DeFi platform on Stacks with enhanced tokenomics, automated DAO governance, DEX subsystem groundwork, circuit breaker & enterprise monitoring, and Bitcoin-aligned principles.

## Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Tests Failing** ‚Äì The test suite is currently failing due to a compilation error in the `protocol-invariant-monitor.clar` contract. This prevents a full assessment of the project's health. While many contracts compile, the overall system is not passing its checks.

[View Complete Status](./documentation/STATUS.md)

## Features

- **Enhanced Tokenomics**: 100M CXVG governance token, 50M CXLP liquidity token with progressive migration & revenue sharing
- **Automated DAO**: Time-weighted voting, timelock, automation & buybacks
- **DEX Foundations**: Factory, pool, router, math-lib, multi-hop & pool variants (design + partial impl)
- **Circuit Breaker & Monitoring**: Structured numeric event codes for volatility, volume & liquidity safeguards
- **Creator Economy**: Merit & automation-driven bounty systems
- **Security & Precision**: Multi-sig treasury, emergency pause, precision math, enterprise monitoring

## Core Principles

- **Security-First & Bitcoin-Aligned**: Every contract is designed with the highest level of security and certainty in mind, reflecting the robustness expected from a Bitcoin-aligned system.
- **High-Value Asset Management**: The platform is built as a financial-grade system for high-value assets, ensuring all logic is sound, transparent, and aligns with best practices in asset management.
- **Code-Rooted Financial Engineering**: All complex financial logic is implemented directly and transparently on-chain in Clarity, ensuring the system's core value is derived from verifiable code, not off-chain processes.

## Quick Start

### For Users
**New to Conxian?** ‚Üí [**User Manual**](./documentation/USER_MANUAL.md) | [Quick Start Guide](./documentation/QUICK_START.md)

### For Developers

#### Requirements

- Node.js (v18+)
  
Note: This repo pins Clarinet SDK v3.5.0 via npm. Always use `npx clarinet`.

#### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anya-org/Conxian.git
cd Conxian
npm run ci
```

This will:
1.  Install all dependencies.
2.  Run the Clarity contract checker (`npx clarinet check`).
3.  Run all TypeScript tests (`npx vitest run`).

Expected output:
- ‚úÖ 75 contracts checked
- ‚úÖ 130 tests passed, 1 skipped

#### Deploy

```bash
# Testnet
../scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# Production  
../scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
```
